## Endpoints

- /identity - allows POST request and returns related contacts for the query. This endpoint only receives data in **RAW JSON**.
- /all-contacts - fetches all related contacts for the query

## Problem Understanding

- A user is only created when we have both email and phone number.

- A new user is created for every new email.

- The first user with a unique email/phone number combination is the primary user.

- All other users with same phone numbers are secondary user.

- A primary user can turn into a secondary user if a pre-existing primary user (say 'adam') is queried with a different phone number then all other users with this phone number, including the primary user(say 'james') become secondary users and point to **adam**.
